# Hi, if you reading this repo, I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to provide an update regarding the repository. As you may have noticed, the current state of the repository is incomplete.
However, I have exciting plans to enhance it by applying the hexagonal architecture.

What is the hexagonal architecture, you ask? It’s a powerful design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and modularization. By adopting this approach, we’ll achieve better maintainability, testability, and scalability.

# Here’s what you can expect moving forward:

I’ll be actively working on completing the missing parts of the repository.
I’ll refactor the existing code to align with the hexagonal architecture principles.

My goal is to create a robust and flexible system that can adapt to changing requirements.

Feel free to explore the existing code, provide feedback, and stay tuned for updates.

Your collaboration and insights are valuable.
